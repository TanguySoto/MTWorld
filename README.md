An artificial ecosystem

![alt tag](https://github.com/TanguySoto/MTWorld/blob/master/Main_image.png)

## Summary

Made entirely with Java and Java OpenGL (JOGL), this project is an ecosystem simulation software with a 3D visualisation. 

This project uses the following concepts :
- cellular automata
- automatic terrain creation (Perlin noise)
- procedural generation (L-system)
- pathfinding (A* algorithm)
- genetic programming
- boids algorithm
- behaviour modelisation
	
Thanks to the interface, user may modify any parameter of the simulation and so create an infinity of different environments.

The Flyer.pdf file gives a quick preview of every feature implemented using above concepts.

## Installation et running

Informations about installation and running can be found in INSTALL.txt located at the root of the repository.
